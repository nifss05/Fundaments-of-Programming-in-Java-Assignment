1. Inheritance in Java
   - It allows one class to inherit features (fields and methods) from another class.
   - Achieved using the extends keyword.
   - Example: MountainBike inherits from Bicycle.

2. Polymorphism
   - Having many forms.
   - Two types: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).

3. Abstraction
   - Hides complex implementation details.
   - Example: Shape class with an abstract draw() method.

4. Abstract vs. Final Method
   - Abstract: No implementation, must be overridden.
   - Final: Cannot be overridden.

5. Final Class in Java
   - Cannot be subclassed.
   - Prevents further extension.

6. Abstraction vs. Encapsulation
   - Abstraction: Hides details, shows necessary functionality.
   - Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods into a single unit (class).

7. Runtime vs. Compile-time Polymorphism
   - Runtime: Achieved through method overriding.
   - Compile-time: Achieved through method overloading.
